<h1>Week 2: September 16, 2024</h1>  
This blog is an ongoing project for Professor Ryan Enos' Election Analytics Course at Harvard College (GOV 1347, Fall 2024). It will be updated weekly with posts analyzing how different features impact the likelihood of Kamala Harris (D) or Donald Trump (R) winning the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election or winning specific states in the election. The blog will culminate in a final predictive model for the outcome of the general election.

LAndmark events in a campaign: debate, convention, "skeleton in the closet" e.g. Access Hollywood

How does the economy impact a candidate's performance?
