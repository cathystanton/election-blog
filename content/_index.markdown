[Week 1](https://cathystanton.github.io/election-blog/post/2024/09/09/forecast-09-09-2024/): In this blog post, I explore the impact of a poll's sponsor on its prediction. Specifically, I'm interested in seeing if the results of unsponsored polls differ from those sponsored by news/media outlets like Reuters or the New York Times.                                  

[Week 2](https://cathystanton.github.io/election-blog/post/2024/09/16/week-2-forecast/): In this week's post, I explore economic predictors of a candidate's success in an election. I focus on whether foreign exchange rates and the strength of the U.S. Dollar can be useful in predicting outcomes.    

[Week 3](https://cathystanton.github.io/election-blog/post/2024/09/21/week-3-forecast/): In this week's blog post, I focus on the role of polls in U.S. presidential elections. I investigate whether close polls correspond to higher voter turnout and whether landslide predictions contribute to lower voter turnout. Then I explore the impications of adjusting for these expected turnout rates in models to achieve more accurate predictions.


[Week 4](https://cathystanton.github.io/election-blog/post/2024/09/29/week-4-forecast/): In this week's post, I explore the effect of incumbency on candidate success and strategy in presidential campaigns since 1948. In particular, I look to see if certain states vote for incumbent candidates more often than others, regardless of partisanship, and evaluate whether campaigns should take that into account when allocating funds/resources.
